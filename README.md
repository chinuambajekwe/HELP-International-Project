# HELP-International-Project
HELP International an NGO, is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people in developing countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities.
â€¨
Task:  Provide the NGO with a group of countries that are in critical conditions. Explore countries in different groups to prioritize when allocating resources.
Action: Used K-means clustering algorithm to determine the optimal number of clusters and categorize countries based on their foreign aid requirement using the development indicators provided.

**Data Distribution**

**Child Mortality**: The dataset shows that many countries have child mortality rates below 50. However, there 
are a few outliers with rates of 100 and above, leading to a right-skewed distribution.

**Exports:** Most countries have export values below 100, but a small number of countries have exports exceeding 
1000, which also results in a right-skewed distribution.

**Health Expenditure**: Health expenditure for the majority of countries ranges between 2% and 12%. Only a few 
countries exceed 14%, creating a right-skewed distribution.

**Imports**: Most countries have import rates below 75%, but some outliers show rates exceeding 100%, indicating 
high import levels.

**Income**: The net income per person for most countries is below 4000. There are a few outliers with income levels 
above 6000, resulting in a right-skewed distribution.

**Inflation**: Most countries have inflation rates between 0% and 20%, with a few outliers exhibiting rates over 20%.

**Life Expectancy**: In contrast to other indicators, life expectancy has a left-skewed distribution. Most countries 
have life expectancy rates between 60 and 80 years, with only a few countries having rates below 50 years.

**Total Fertility**: Over half of the countries have fertility rates below 4%. There are also some outliers with 
rates reaching up to 7%.

**GDP**: GDP per capita for most countries is below 2000, but there are outliers with values as high as 100,000, 
resulting in a right-skewed distribution.

**Exploring Relationships across Variables**

**Variables with high positive correlation**
- Total fertility and Child Mortality: The higher the fertility rates, the higher the child mortality rate
  
-Imports and Exports: The higher the imports, the higher the exports. So 
countries that have high exports also import a lot.

-Income and exports: The higher the countries exports, the higher their income,
which is intuitive because the foreign exchange obtained from selling locally produced goods
increases the net income per person. 

- Gdp and Income: The higher the Gross domestic product of a coutry, the higher 
their income.

- Life expectancy and GDP: The higher the country's GDP, the higher their life expectancy.

**Variables with high negative correlation**
- Income and Child Mortality:The higher the country's net income per person, the lower its 
child mortality.

- Life expectancy and Total fertility: The higher the country's fertility rate, the lower
its life expectancy

**Clustering Process**

Optimal number of clusters

[visualization5.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16949641/visualization5.pdf)


**Cluster Definition**
 Class 0 - requires urgent foreign aid
 Class 1 - No foreign aid 
 Class 2 - not a priority

Clustering Insights:
Most countries in Africa require foreign aid urgently. These countries are characterized 
by low levels of development which is evidenced by indicators such as  
- high child mortality rates
- ligh inflation rate
- high fertility rates
- low health expenditure
- high total fertility rate

Certain countries in the Middle East and Asia are in urgent need of foreign aid. In South America, only a handful of countries require immediate assistance. Meanwhile, countries in North America and Europe do not need foreign aid.
